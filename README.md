# CV_Asymmetries_Paper_2024

This is a backup store of my PhD research code folder for projects CV line asymmetries investigation of EW excesses.

The repository currently includes:
- Emission Line Asymmetries:
    - Seeing excess equivalent widths either side of emission lines to prove or disprove asymmetries from wind signatures.
  
- Rebinning_Spec_Tot_vs_Spec_Spectra:
    - A script to rebin the ionisation cycles spectra vs the spectral cycles spectra for PYTHON. This was due to a discrepancy
        identified by Ed on ~Jan 24. Shown to have no (or negligible) effects on the grids I am using.
